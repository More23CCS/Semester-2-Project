		<h1>Modern Computers</h1>
		<h2>Programmable</h2>
    <p>A programmable computer is a machine that can execute a set of instructions, called a program, to perform a specific task or set of tasks. These instructions can be written by a human and stored in memory, allowing the computer to be reprogrammed to perform different tasks.</p>
    <h2>Digital</h2>
    <p>A digital computer is a machine that processes information using a binary system of ones and zeros. In a digital computer, all data is converted into binary digits (bits), which can then be processed and manipulated by the computer's circuits and logic gates. This allows digital computers to perform complex calculations and store large amounts of data.</p>
    <h2>Electronic</h2>
    <p>An electronic computer is a machine that uses electronic components, such as transistors and integrated circuits, to process information. Unlike earlier mechanical and electromechanical computers, which used gears, levers, and relays to perform calculations, electronic computers can perform calculations much more quickly and efficiently, making them ideal for complex tasks such as scientific simulations, data processing, and artificial intelligence.</p>
