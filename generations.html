		<h1>Generations of Computers</h1>
		<h2>First Generation (1940s-1950s)</h2>
		<p>The first generation of computers spanned from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. These early computers were built using vacuum tubes and had limited processing power and memory. They were large and expensive, often filling entire rooms, and were primarily used for scientific and military applications such as codebreaking and calculations. </p>
    <p>Programs were written in machine language, which was difficult and time-consuming, and input and output were typically done using punched cards and paper tape. The UNIVAC (UNIVersal Automatic Computer) and the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) are two notable examples of first-generation computers.</p>
		
		<h2>Second Generation (1950s-1960s)</h2>
		<p>The second generation of computers emerged in the late 1950s and lasted until the mid-1960s. These computers were built using transistors, which were smaller, cheaper, and more reliable than vacuum tubes. This led to a significant increase in processing power and memory, making these computers more versatile and accessible. The introduction of magnetic tape and disks allowed for faster input and output of data, and programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL made it easier to write and run programs. </p>
    <p>Second-generation computers were still large and expensive, but they were also used in commercial applications such as accounting and inventory management. IBM's System/360 and the DEC PDP-8 were two prominent second-generation computers.</p>
		
		<h2>Third Generation (1960s-1970s)</h2>
		<p>The third generation of computers emerged in the mid-1960s and lasted until the late 1970s. These computers were built using integrated circuits, which allowed for even greater processing power and memory than previous generations. They were smaller, faster, and more reliable, and were often used in scientific research, military applications, and business operations. The development of operating systems such as UNIX and programming languages such as C and BASIC made it easier to write and run programs, and the introduction of the computer mouse and graphical user interface (GUI) made computers more user-friendly. </p>
    <p>Third-generation computers were also used for the development of the internet, which revolutionized communication and information exchange. The IBM System/370 and the DEC PDP-11 were two notable third-generation computers.</p>
		
		<h2>Fourth Generation (1970s-Present)</h2>
		<p>The fourth generation of computers emerged in the late 1970s and continues to the present day. These computers are built using microprocessors, which are smaller, faster, and more powerful than previous generations. They are also more affordable and widely available, making them accessible to individuals and small businesses. The introduction of personal computers and laptops, as well as software such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS, made computers even more user-friendly and versatile.</p>
    <p>Fourth-generation computers are used in virtually all aspects of modern life, from entertainment to education to healthcare. They continue to evolve and improve, with developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing promising to transform computing even further in the years to come.</p>
